FINMA ICO Guidelines

Refer to attached FINMA ICO Guidelines.pdf

My area of interest lies at the bidirectional process of representing real-world assets digitally on a distributed ledger (i.e., tokenisation) and the area of enforcement of the exchange.  

Question to explore further: is the asset native to the chain or is the asset a digital representation of an existing off-chain asset? how can one enforce this exchange? Through the use of smart contracts, perhaps? 

Tokenisation: refers to the process of digitally representing an existing, off-chain asset on a distributed ledger
