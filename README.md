FINMA ICO Guidelines

Refer to attached FINMA ICO Guidelines.pdf

My area of interest lies at the bidirectional process of representing real-world assets digitally on a distributed ledger (i.e., tokenisation) and the area of enforcement of the exchange.  

Question to explore further: is the asset native to the chain or is the asset a digital representation of an existing off-chain asset? how can one enforce this exchange? Through the use of smart contracts, perhaps? 

Tokenisation: refers to the process of digitally representing an existing, off-chain asset on a distributed ledger

Few ways to think about tokens/ico:
First, is it [token] valuable as an investment or because it’s a “useful item?” Next, “is there an issuer backing up that value, or is the value the result of a network of unaffiliated participants in an industry and market?”

Bitcoin’s token, for example, has no backer and its value is completely reliant on a network. But in many other cases, a token is “little bit useful and a little bit profitable,” and its value is “a little bit derived from the efforts of an issuer and a little bit derived from a massive network of strangers,”
